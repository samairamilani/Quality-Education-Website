    The United Nations (UN) has set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. 
    The SDGs address a wide range of issues, from poverty, hunger, and health, to education, gender equality, and climate change. They were developed in response to the urgent need to address global challenges and build a more sustainable future for everyone.
    The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) exist because there is an urgent need to address the many challenges facing our world today. 
    The SDGs are an ambitious and comprehensive set of goals that aim to tackle the most pressing challenges facing the world today. They represent a shared vision of a more sustainable, just, and prosperous future for everyone, and provide a framework for governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals to work together to achieve this vision.
The SDGs build on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were adopted by the United Nations in 2000 and set out to eradicate poverty, improve education, and reduce child mortality, among other objectives. The SDGs are more comprehensive than the MDGs, and aim to address a wider range of economic, social, and environmental issues.
The SDGs are also intended to be universal, applying to all countries, regardless of their level of development. They recognize that sustainable development requires a global effort, with all countries and stakeholders working together to achieve common goals.

Overall, the SDGs exist to provide a roadmap for achieving a more sustainable and equitable future for all people, and to mobilize action and resources to make this vision a reality. They represent a shared vision of a better world, and provide a framework for collaboration and partnership among governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals to achieve this vision.
